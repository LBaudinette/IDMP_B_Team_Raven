  - Welcome to the third and final step of employee onboarding, Employee #47971712!
    You'll be out there and successfully setting up Dimensional Harvests in no time.
  - As the contents of pocket dimensions are largely unknown until entered, your
    placement of Pyrrhus Co. Miners and Transportation Pipes may unintentionally
    obstruct your ability to successfully set up a Dimensional Harvest.
  - In the case that you are unable to complete your Dimensional Harvest, or otherwise
    end up stranded in a pocket dimension, don't worry!
  - "You can press \u2018R\u2019 to manually trigger your Pyrrhus Co. Local Temporal
    Rewind Device if you run into any issues! Easy, right?"
  - However, it is best practice to plan your traversal and construction ahead of
    time to avoid negative situations in which you may be legally or mortally liable
    for.
