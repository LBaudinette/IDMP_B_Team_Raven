  - Greetings, Employee #971712, and welcome your first shift in Dimensional Production!
  - "As you may know, Earth is suffering from an extreme lack of natural resources
    \u2013 what little is left on the planet is extremely difficult to access, even
    for our advanced machinery. "
  - "As such, Pyrrhus Co. has been granted international subsidies to solve this
    issue. That\u2019s where you come in!"
  - "By leveraging proprietary Pyrrhus Co. technology, we\u2019re able to open pocket
    dimensions, and send employees like you to harvest natural resources from them
    instead!"
  - If, for any reason, you get stuck, please press the R key - but more on that
    later!
  - Start by moving to the blue mineral node by clicking on adjacent nodes with LMB.
